# Smart Flashcard Backend

This is a backend service for a **smart flashcard system** built using **Fastify** and **SQLite**.  
Users can add flashcards (question & answer), and the backend automatically infers the subject (e.g., Physics, Biology) using simple rule-based classification.  
Flashcards can later be fetched in a mixed-subject batch for each student.
- REST API with OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
